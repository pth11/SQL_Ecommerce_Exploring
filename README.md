# BigQuery_Ecommerce_project
Utilized SQL in Google BigQuery to write and execute queries to find the desired data

## I. Introduction

This project contains an eCommerce dataset that I will explore using SQL on Google BigQuery. The dataset is based on the Google Analytics public dataset and contains data from an eCommerce website.

## II. Dataset Access

The eCommerce dataset is stored in a public Google BigQuery dataset. To access the dataset, follow these steps:

- Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account and create a new project.
- Navigate to the BigQuery console and select your newly created project.
- In the navigation panel, select "Add Data" and then "Search a project".
- Enter the project ID "bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions" and click "Enter".
- Click on the "ga_sessions_" table to open it.

## III. Exploring the Dataset

In this project, I will write 08 query in Bigquery base on Google Analytics dataset. Please see the coding file attached above

## IV. Conclusion
- In general, this project has demonstrated the power of using SQL and big data tools like Google BigQuery to gain insights into large datasets.
- By exploring the eCommerce dataset, I have gained valuable information about total visits, pageviews, transactions, bounce rates,  revenue per traffic source, etc., which could inform future business decisions.
- To deep dive into the insights and key trends, the next step is to visualize output with visualization platforms like Power BI, Tableau,...
